<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'> 
  <p>While WebRTC specifies the usage of SDPs [RFC8866] and an Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] for creating connections, WebRTC does not define the precise signaling protocols over which SDPs should be exchanged [RFC8825]. In order to establish a WebRTC session between two WebRTC entities, a signaling protocol is usually used to exchange SDPs</p>
  <p>With HTTP/S applications, WHIP and WHEP have been proposed as simple protocols to ingest and egress media streams using WebRTC.</p>
  <p>This specification provides the means to do likewise in XMPP for communicating user media streams using WebRTC-based ingestion/egress. The WebRTC SDP payload format is transported using IQ stanzas which map directly to WHIP and WHEP REST endpoints.</p>
  <p>This specification does not prescribe a method for the security, discovery, publishing and subscription of published media stream keys. It is assumed that this will be achieved with other XMPP mechanisms like &xep0060; or &xep0482; for example.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic="Requirements" anchor="reqs">
  <ul>	  
    <li>Be as easy to implement as possible. This is grounded on the idea that most XMPP implementation programming languages already have HTTP libraries available.</li>
    <li>Usable with WebRTC-based broadcasting providers that have no XMPP integration.</li>
    <li>Usable with XMPP client applications that may have no HTTP/S access to the WebRTC-based ingestion/egress service.</li>	
    <li>Anyone who knows the WHIP and WHEP REST Endpoints SHOULD be able to access them as well.</li>
    <li>WHIP and WHEP media streams should map directly to XMPP Jingle sessions with uni-directional media streams. &xep0482; with a stream key URI and a Jingle session identifier SHOULD be referencing the same media stream.</li>	
  </ul>

<section1 topic="Discovering Support" anchor="disco">
  <section2 topic="Discovery Query" anchor="disco-initiation">
    <p>The entity advertises support for WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, as specified by this protocol, by including the "urn:xmpp:whip:0" namespace, as well as "urn:xmpp:whep:0" namespaces in its service discovery information features as specified in in &xep0030;.</p>
    <p>If the entity can push ice candidates patches from the WebRTC-based ingestion/egress, it SHOULD include 'urn:xmpp:whip:ice:0' and 'urn:xmpp:whep:ice:0' namespaces. If the WebRTC-based egress supports extensions, then it SHOULD also include the 'urn:xmpp:whep:ext:0' namespace. </p>
	<p>If the entity can transcribe voice into text from an ingested media stream, it SHOULD include the 'urn:xmpp:whip:transcribe:0' namespace.</p>
